wasnt expected experiences i had, and ive gained my skills

## result

initially i were down more like scared of people who joined this intern since they all came from famous uni and were proven

but everyone w so kind like we talked funny and technical stuff in discord (at ニホンカモジカ5 ) every day

and thats why i could enjoy and solve mayn problems!

## what the dog(me the 🐶) doing

## what i did

since I were getting interested in developing native apps (iOS and Android) and backend, doe i were considering solving problems related to golang backend and react frontend, I challenged completely another area of CS.

i learned swift and kotlin within 3 days and could solve a few issues (a little tiny bugfix doe)

## lets join the DMM GUILD 2022!
